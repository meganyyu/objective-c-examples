//  Each class defines 2 things:
//  1. Attributes - name, height, weight, age
//  2. Behavior - walk, run, jump, speak, sleep
//  Objects are then created from classes. One class, multiple objects.
//
//  A method is a function that belongs to a class.

        // Thinking about scope - when we reach the end of a function and local objects are no longer reachable by any part of the program, the pointer is removed, the retain count goes down
        // When the retain count goes to 0, the Obj-C runtime engine releases that area of memory and make it available for another object to use

        // Problems with manual ref counting:
        // 1. Dangling pointer: you might release memory too soon
        // 2. Memory leak: claiming more & more memory bc never release objects even as pointers drop out of scope
        
        // ARC is now done by compiler
        // Very different from garbage collection! Languages that use garbage collection are non-deterministic - you can't tell exactly when objects are being reclaimed bc it's managed by the runtime by an external process.
