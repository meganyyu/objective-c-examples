        // 1. General use: defining a new class for application, so you inherit from standard base class (i.e. NSObject)
        // 2. Specialized use: it's common in other obj-oriented languages to almost always be inheriting from more specialized classes because built-in ones don't have exactly the functionality you want
        // We don't need to do #2 as much in Objective-C because we have categories
